# Notes

- Order notation provement

  - ex) n**2 + 10n  E  Big O(n**2)

- properties of Order notation

  reference from lecture Chap1-4

- Time Complexity of recurrence equations

  Using [Master Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_theorem_(analysis_of_algorithms))

  - ex) Time Complexity of Merge Sort is Theta(nlgn)
